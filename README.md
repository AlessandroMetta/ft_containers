# ft_containers

the aim of the project is re-coding the most common standard template library container and relative functions

### to-do-list
#### vector: finished
#### map: started
#### stack: absent

## useful information
- obviously read and understand deeply the subject
- You can find all the information for understand the Containers on the references sites
- first of all, understand the std::allocator class. It's FOUNDAMENTAL!
- Personally I found this project really difficult, the only sugggestion I can give to you is take your time
to understand the container then try to code, if it fail, try again, and do not stop doing that.
